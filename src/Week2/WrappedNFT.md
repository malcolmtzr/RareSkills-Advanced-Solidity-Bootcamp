There are many use cases for wrapped NFTs. 

Wrapped NFTs can be used for governance on DAOs where the owner of the wrapped NFT can participate in on-chain voting. 

In DeFi/NFT-Fi, wrapped NFTs can be used for fractionalizded trading, renting, representation of liquidity positions (UniswapV3), yield boosting in staking protocols etc.

In gaming, wrapped NFTs could be used to add "enhancements" to the original NFT based on game progression and loot rewards.

Upgrading an NFT collection with more functionalities.

Identity verification - proof of personhood/humanity (worldcoin)

Wrapping the original NFT to allow participation in different markets, like auctions and sales, metaverse participation, digital asset security, real estate, etc.

More interestingly, wrapped NFT pattern allows NFT interoperability between different chains - for example, Lil Pudgies are able to cross-chain from Ethereum to Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.

In short, the use of wrapped NFTs ultimately comes down to how a project wishes to create use cases for their NFT collection.
